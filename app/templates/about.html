                                ...developed with the initial goal of being so simple and foolproof that anyone could utilise the protection it offers, regardless of technical ability. 
                                The initial idea came from diceware password generation, which recommends that users use passwords comprised of five or more sequential words rather than 
                                short, overly complex passwords that are difficult to remember. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At a similar time I noticed that, when trying to write up a list of rules for my parents to 
                                follow when trying to identify spam emails, I could never comprehensively guarantee that an email was from its sender - particularly if the attackers has put 
                                thought into their email design and had spear phished its recipient. The medium was lacking a form of mutual authentication.
                            </p>
                            <p>These two ideas combined to form Checkmate codes</p>
                            <p>
                                I do not expect Checkmate to become the next big thing. It would be difficult and morally dubious for me to 
                                monetise such a simple and effective idea, so for now, I'm willing to let it live on as a record: a trophy of the 
                                first big idea I had that I carried all the way through from start to finish.
                            </p>
